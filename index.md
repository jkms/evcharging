First and foremost, if your parking stall is in the range of R27 --> R32, you're currently missing the electrical circuits required to have an EV Charger installed.  Be advised that I am in communication with Bucci regarding this, and hope to have them remediate this without any cost to us (I can't promise that, but I will share updates as they become available to me).

## Installation Costs

Assuming you're not in one of the aforementioned stalls, then we need to calculate the cost of installation based on your distance from the nearest junction box.  Please advise which option applies to you:

* $300 - There's an available junction box at your stall
* $550 - There's an available junction box one stall away from your stall
* $725 - There's an available junction box two stalls away from your stall

These costs cover the following as needed:
* Metal Conduit From Existing Junction Box
* New Junction Box
* Armored Cable From Junction Box To Charger
* Mounting of a Level 2 Charger To Wall


Finally, the bulk of the cost is the charger itself and activation fees.  The costs break down like this:

Level 2 charger: $1,960

* SWTCH Joint Tech 32Amp Level 2 Charger x 1
* Commissioning
* One Time SWTCH Activation Fee - $75
* 1-Years Of SWTCH Management - $210

Please note that this price includes the annual subscription cost of $210 to SWTCH.  This fee is paid yearly by every resident with a charger.  The fee is per charger, and is our cost to SWTCH for operating their service.

To summarize the costs of installation, if your parking stall is 2 stalls from a junction box, then your cost would be:

```
$550 for the conduit to the junction box
+ 
$1,960 for the charger and fees
= $2,510 before tax
+ 5% GST
= $2,635.5
```

For this first wave of installs, I am gathering all of this information for the residents prepared to purchase a charger and entering it into an interactive quote.  If you would like to see that quote system, it is available here: https://tcaelectric.proposify.com/preview/VzBzZUxEc0gvRkxHYU1yVDVTTk1Xdz09


## Operating Costs

The price for electricity is $1.40/hour, prorated (in Canada, you need a special utilities license to sell electricity by the kWh, so the way around this is to charge by the hour).  Please note that this cost is prorated, meaning that if you're charging on the same circuit as another resident, and you're both drawing 50% power, then you'll only be charged $0.70/hour.


And finally, we're also registering for the BC Carbon credits program.  To briefly oversimplify this, the act of charging an EV for a year is considered a Carbon Offset, and the credit for this is then sold to a broker who will bundle these credits and resell them to the likes of Shell or Petro Canada or any other large, Carbon intensive corporation.  This results in a cash rebate for residents with EV Chargers.

I cannot offer any guestimates on how much these rebates may be worth, as they're subject to market conditions and government policy.  It could be a lot one year, and then next to nothing the following year, and may be cancelled at any time.  But, it's basically free money for anyone with an EV Charger while the program lasts, so we might as well take it.


## FAQ:

### What services are provided by the $210 Annual Service Fee

SWTCH are offering a solution to a problem we have - either we pull in one circuit for every single stall (this would costs hundreds of thousands of dollars), or we work with a provider such as SWTCH who operates an OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) system.  SWTCH operates and supports this infrastructure.  If you have a problem with your account or your hardware, you call them for support.  They coordinate electricians.  They issue and manage RFID cards.  And they sell our carbon offset credits to help defray costs.  Like it or not, they offer a service that we need, and they make a profit doing so.  There aren't many competitors in this space, and SWTCH is definitely not the most expensive operator.

### If I rent out my unit, how does billing work for the tenant?

The Renters can open an account, and pay the monthly fee.  Each charger has an ID, so you get a hold of SWTCH and say you want to Activate Charger 5555, use this credit card.  The renter can then cancel at any time.

Or the owner does it, and adds the fee to their rent.
